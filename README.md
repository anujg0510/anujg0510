Hi, I’m Anuj, a Data Science learner at Univ of Toronto and iNeuron.

I love to explore on the value-add that existing data can bring to the organizations that own the data. 

Currently working on honing my skills in Machine Learning problems focussed on Regression and Classification.

For any project collaborations or coffee catch-ups, I can be reached at anuj0510@gmail.com
